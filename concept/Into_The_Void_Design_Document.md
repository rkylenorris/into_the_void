# Into The Void – Game Design Document

## Overview
*Into The Void* is a text-based, Jungian-inspired psychological dungeon crawler that blends introspective journaling, symbolic transformation, and rich narrative exploration.

## Core Themes
- Jungian Psychology (Archetypes, Shadow, Individuation)
- Symbolism (Tarot, Myth, Ritual)
- Reflection (Guided journaling, grounding, transformation)
- Exploration (A dreamlike island shaped by the player's psyche)

## Player Psyche System
- Player stats are modeled after psyche elements:
  - Ego
  - Id
  - Superego (possibly renamed)
  - Persona
  - Anima/Animus
  - Shadow
  - Self (unlockable)
- Each aspect has a presence score from -50 to +50
- Presence shifts affect:
  - Dialogue options
  - Environmental tone
  - Available rituals
  - NPC behavior

## Game Loop
1. Explore symbolic environments
2. Encounter narrative moments, NPCs, puzzles
3. Decide: choices alter psyche presence levels
4. Reflect: guided journaling sessions offered
5. Transform: world shifts based on psyche
6. Return: previously visited places may change

## The Void Journal (In-Game Feature)
- Tracks:
  - Aspect presence history (graph)
  - Tarot card draws + reflections
  - Player journal entries
  - Grounding techniques used
  - Key symbolic NPCs
  - Rituals performed and their effects

## Tarot Integration
- Draws occur at key transitions, high psyche shifts, or ritual zones
- Cards influence narrative and offer reflection prompts
- Tarot archetypes can appear in dreams, rituals, NPCs
- Saved in the Void Journal with custom interpretation

## Grounding Techniques
- Triggered before/after emotionally intense segments
- Player can activate at any time
- Examples: 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding, breath work, visualization
- Tracked in Void Journal

## Ritual System
- Performed in specific liminal locations
- Require defined aspect thresholds (e.g., Shadow ≥ 30)
- Categories:
  - Transformative: alter psyche presence
  - Divinatory: reveal hidden knowledge
  - Binding/Unbinding: alter memory or NPCs
  - Revelatory: unlock journal entries or dreams
- Rituals can:
  - Alter environments
  - Unlock new areas
  - Trigger dreams or world shifts
  - Echo in later encounters

## NLP Integration (Planned)
- Player journal entries analyzed via NLP:
  - Extract names, objects, symbols, emotional tone
- Used to:
  - Personalize dream sequences
  - Modify Tarot interpretations
  - Generate symbolic NPCs or artifacts
- Tracked keywords can return later in narrative as emergent myth

## Future Expansion Ideas
- A “Reflected Self” NPC built from journal archetypes
- Ritual Tree by Aspect
- Randomly generated dreamscape based on dominant presence state
